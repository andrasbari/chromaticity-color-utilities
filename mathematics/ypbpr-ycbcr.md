# YPbPr to YCbCr
#### Analog $\rightleftarrows$ Digital

## YPbPr to YCbCr

Scaling bounds given by conversion method / target space. Typical bounds might be 0-255 for all values for JPEG target or 16-235 for Y and 16-245 for Cb and Cr for Rec. 709 target.

## YCbCr to YPbPr

Y is scaled to 0-1, Cb and Cr are scaled such that Pb and Pr are between -0.5 and 0.5.
